				I recently worked for a contract position with Bell under the facilities department where I identified and analyzed electrical system configuration of mission critical facilites. Although my experience is sparse and varied, as I've only recently graduated university, I always give my all to my job and do my best to take every opportunity to learn.

			<p class="details">I worked with a DCIM application called Struxureware DCE that allowed me to remotely configure devices that we have installed at three datacentre sites in two cities. These devices were RPDU's and RPP's that fed the various servers. In order for these devices to be discovered by DCE, I needed to remotely reach them on a back-channel private network through an RPD platform we made available, and configure each of of them from SNMPv1 to SNMPv3. Subsequently, I needed to run DCE discoveries to bring them into DCE. This was required to conform to security policies wherein SNMPv1 was banned but SNMPv3 was allowed.</p>
            <p class="details">I also worked on a UPS platform failover analysis wherein I needed to determine load levels assumed by each of four UPS systems arranged in 2N configurations to ensure that should one UPS fail completely, the other N system would be able to safely assume the load. This required manipulation of Excel-based load formulas to determine each situationâ€™s failover.</p>
